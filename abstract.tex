Developing machine learning-based signal classifiers that generalize well requires training data that capture the underlying probability distribution of real signals. To synthesize a set of training data that can capture the large variance in signal characteristics, a robust, low bias, low decay framework that can support arbitrary baseband signals and channel conditions is required. Furthermore, domain adaptation can allow for powerful generalized training via transforms on unlabeled evaluation-time signals. Together, domain transforms and a robust training set can train a deep neural net to perform well in many real-world scenarios.
