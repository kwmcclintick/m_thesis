I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Professor Alexander Wyglinski for his continuous guidance and support towards my degree. I am very thankful for the opportunity to work with him in the Wireless Innovation Laboratory at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

I want to thank Professor Kaveh Pahlavan and Dr. Travis Collins for serving on my committee and providing valuable suggestions and comments with regards to my thesis. 

I would also like to thank my WILab team members Dr. Srikanth Pagadarai, Kuldeep, Renato, and Nivetha for their immense support during my graduate studies. I would like to thank my friends abroad and in the states who have stayed in contact and given me the support I need, including my friends from Audrey Ave: Alex and the Armstrongs, Ben, Elissa, Ivan, Thomas, and Vlad, my fraternity brothers from Lambda Chi Alpha and Theta Xi, who are too many to mention here, and the Lakeside bunch: Alia, Kelly, Gene, Jack, Jon, Nate, and Nic. I would like to thank good beer, catchy music, and sunny weekends. Finally, I'm thankful for my lovely girlfriend Zhijie, and my warm family: Colin, Dawn, and George. Without their constant support I wouldn't have finished this thesis.
