Developing machine learning-based signal classifiers that generalize well
requires training data that capture the underlying probability distribution of
real signals.  To synthesize a set of training data that can capture the large
variance in signal characteristics, a robust framework that can support arbi-
trary baseband signals and channel conditions is required.  Furthermore, a
classifier trained on a probability distribution that reflects the expected range
of channel conditions is better able to detect anomalies (e.g., poisoning at-
tacks).
